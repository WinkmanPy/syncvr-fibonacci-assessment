# FibonacciFibonacci is a simple Flask REST API that returns a given number from Fibonacci's sequence.## Installation* Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Fibonacci.```bashpip install flask```* Set /Fibonacci as Current Working Directory```bashexport FLASK_APP=App.pyexport FLASK_DEBUG=1flask run```## UsageAccess Fibonacci's sequence from browser.http://127.0.0.1:5000/fibonacci/5{   "5": 5  }http://127.0.0.1:5000/fibonacci/45{   "45": 1134903170    }Get history.http://127.0.0.1:5000/fibonacci/history{   5, 45   }Clear history.http://127.0.0.1:5000/fibonacci/clear## Design decisionsI started creating fibonacci.py to build the recursive mechanism of the sequence.I added a dictionary to preload the first 50 entries of the sequence for performance.Since I have some previous experience with Flask, I decided to build the API in Python.
